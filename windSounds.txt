## Allan Giddy - wind-controlled sample playback (2020)
## Code by Elias Berkhout

# input comes in the form of reed switches from a wind turbine
# direction variable, from 0-15, represents wind direction
# 0 = N, 1 = NNE, 2 = NE, etc
# each direction has its own looping sample, which will
# play until a new direction is received
# values are received from a Python script reading the GPIO pins

# first, create a path to the folder containing the relevant samples
# for now this directs to the default sonic pi samples
# TO-DO: mkdir for samples on the desktop
samps = "/opt/sonic-pi/etc/samples"

# samps = "/home/pi/Desktop/turbine/samples"

# create direction variable to store wind direction
# declare that it is sync'd to received OSC messages
direction = sync "/osc*/play"

# live loop receives OSC messages and updates direction variable when a new value is received
live_loop :dir do
  direction = sync "/osc*/play"
end

# second live loop to play audio
# the value of the direction variable controls which sample is selected
# the selected sample will loop until a new message is received
live_loop :listen do
  # store the length of the currently selected sample
  s_length = sample_duration samps, direction
  
  # print the current direction value (0-15)
  puts direction
  
  # play the sample from the samps path, [direction] index, ie. if direction == 0, play sample 0 in the directory
  sample samps, direction
  sleep s_length
end
